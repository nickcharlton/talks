# talks

Some talks I've given, with the associated source.

I use [Deckset][].

## [Maintaining Open Source Software](/maintaining-open-source)

> What’s it like to maintain an open source project? How could you get involved
> in one yourself? How do you know what you’re doing is working?
>
> We’ll discuss my experience taking over administrate, how you can do
> something similar and discuss some strategies to make maintaining projects
> easier.

Previously given at [NHS Digital][], [Sheffield Ruby User Group][] (where
[it was filmed][]) and [FutureSync 2019][].

## [Yet Another Intro to AI](/intro-to-ai)

> What do we mean when we talk about AI? What have thoughtbot been doing?
> What's new? What problems should we avoid?

This was originally based on the idea of covering "trends, opportunities and
challenges" in AI/ML projects, so it sets a little scene for what that means,
talks about common problems and goes into some detail on some work we've been
doing recently.

Previously given at a lunch and learn at [Forward Partners][].

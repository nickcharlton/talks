Some talks I've given, with the associated source.

I use [Deckset][].

## [Maintaining Open Source Software](/maintaining-open-source)

> What’s it like to maintain an open source project? How could you get involved
> in one yourself? How do you know what you’re doing is working?
>
> We’ll discuss my experience taking over administrate, how you can do
> something similar and discuss some strategies to make maintaining projects
> easier.
